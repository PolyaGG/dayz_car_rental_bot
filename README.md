# dayz_car_rental_bot
DayZ Rental Bot is a Discord bot for managing vehicle rentals on a DayZ server. Players can rent vehicles through Discord, with rental fees deducted every 10 minutes. The bot automatically creates vehicle files in a virtual garage, deducts money from the player's bank account, and removes the vehicle if funds run out.
